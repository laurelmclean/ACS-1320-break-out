# Breakout Game

A classic arcade Break Out type game, following the
[mdn web docs tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript). The game was originally written using a simple but limiting approach with vanilla JS, and through this assignment I have improved the quality of the code used in the game by using Object Oriented Programming (OOP) techniques.
